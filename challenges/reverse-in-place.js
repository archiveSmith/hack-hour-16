 * Write a function to reverse an array in place

 * In some languages, strings are mutable (like in Ruby). In other languages,

 * be changed after they're created.

 * Since strings are immutable in javascript, we will be reversing an array of characters instead.
 *
 * DO NOT USE THE BUILT IN REVERSE METHOD
